## Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

* **Value-Based Methods:**
    * Q-Learning
    * SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)

* **Policy-Based Methods:**
    * Policy Gradients
    * Actor-Critic Methods

* **Model-Based Methods:**
    * Model Predictive Control (MPC)
    * Dyna-Q

* **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG):** For continuous control problems.

* **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO):** Addresses limitations of vanilla policy gradients.

* **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL):** Trains multiple agents to cooperate/compete.
